[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elastest/elastest-service-manager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elastest/elastest-service-manager)

This is the elastest service manager that is responsible for providing support service instances to test jobs. 
It's an implementation of the [Open Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker), v2.12, 
with further extensions ([See the spec for further details](http://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastest/elastest-service-manager/master/api.yaml)).

# What is ElasTest

This repository is part of [ElasTest], which is an open source elastic platform
aimed to simplify end-to-end testing. ElasTest platform is based on three
principles: i) Test orchestration: Combining intelligently testing units for
creating a more complete test suite following the “divide and conquer” principle.
ii) Instrumentation and monitoring: Customizing the SuT (Subject under Test)
infrastructure so that it reproduces real-world operational behavior and allowing
to gather relevant information during testing. iii) Test recommendation: Using machine
learning and cognitive computing for recommending testing actions and providing
testers with friendly interactive facilities for decision taking.

# Documentation

The [ElasTest] project provides detailed documentation including tutorials,
installation and development guide.

## Generated Code
Some of the code in the ESM is generated using [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).
See `./gen_api_skels.sh` on how the command line is to generate the code.
The ESM uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

To run the ESM, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 ./runesm.py
```

If you want to view the Swagger UI you can simply navigate to this URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```

To retrieve the swagger specification of the running ESM simply use `curl` or `wget` against this URL
```
http://localhost:8080/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
pip install tox
tox
```
## Overview
This service broker was in part generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub. Using the swagger specification for this broker, you can also generate a client to interact with the broker, should `curl` not be your preference. The implementation uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask and requires Python 3.6. To use Python 3.5 you will need the `typing` module dependency, but this is included in the `requirements.txt` file. Python 2.x is not supported.

To launch the tests, use tox:
```shell
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running It

Ensure you have all dependencies required: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Configure the following OS environment variables:

* `ESM_PORT`: this is the port under which the service broker runs. By default it runs on `8080`.

Example config and run:

```shell
export ESM_PORT=9999
./runme.py
 * ESM_PORT: 9999
 ./runme.py
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:9999/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

The service manager endpoint should only be the scheme (http or https) and the fully qualified host name, optionally including the port number if it differs from the standard port 80 or 443.

## Viewing the API

Navigate to the following URL in your browser

```
http://localhost:8080/v2/ui/
```

The OSBA Swagger definition can be accessed here:

```
http://localhost:8080/v2/swagger.json
```

## Using the API

To use the API please see the [open service broker API specification](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/) or use the UI version from within your browser.

      "plan_updateable": false,

        }
      ],
      "tags": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### Provision (create) a service instance

```shell
curl -v -d @payload.json -X PUT -H "X-Broker-API-Version: 2.12" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:9999/v2/service_instances/123-123-123\?accept_incomplete\=true
```

where `payload.json` is:

```json
{
  "organization_guid": "my-org-id-very-rich-company",
  "plan_id":           "plan-id-for-free",
  "service_id":        "a_service_type",
  "space_guid":        "space-guid-here",
  "parameters":        {
    "parameter1": 1,
    "parameter2": "value"
  }
}
```

`curl` will output

```shell
*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connection failed
* connect to ::1 port 9999 failed: Connection refused
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...

### Bind and Unbind

Currently not supported.

## Extending

### Data Store

Subclass `adapters.datastore.Store` and implement for you persistence system.

Currently supported:

* `adapters.datastore.InMemoryStore`: this is a datastore driver that holds all ESM state in memory. To be used for testing only as restarting the ESM process will destroy all recorded information.


* `adapters.datastore.MongoDB`: this is a datastore driver that persists all ESM state into mongodb. Data is kept across reboots of the ESM process.

### Resource Manager

Subclass `adapters.resources.Backend` and implement for you persistence system. You will then have to register your Backend driver with the `adapters.resources.EPM` class.

Currently supported:

* `adapters.resources.DummyBackend`: This is a NoOp driver used for speedy testing.


* `adapters.resources.DockerBackend`: Uses a docker-compose file to deploy the service software. This can point not only to a local docker deployment (not distributed), but also to a docker swarm.

## Deploy on Docker

There is a docker build file `./Dockerfile` in the root of this project. You can use this to create a docker image that can then be ran upon your local docker environment.

There is also a docker compose file `./docker-compose` in the root of this project. You can use this to bring up the ESM with a DB backend.

## Deploy on OpenShift

TO FOLLOW...

There are deployment manifests within `./deploy` that will deploy a service broker to OpenShift. There are two main modifications that you will have to do:

1. Change the route `./deploy/sv_route.yaml`. See line 11.
2. Change the configuration of the service broker. Configuration is done by modifying `./deploy/sb_dc.yaml` under the `env` stanza, lines 31-38. 
3. Deploy: `oc create -f ./deploy`.
4. Build: `oc start-build svcbroker`.
5. Destroy: `oc delete -f ./deploy`.

## Deploy on K8s

TODO

## Notes

To build the swagger-codegen [tool yourself](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/master#building)

``` sh
# server files
# assumes a brew installation of swagger code gen
SWAGGER_CODE_GEN="/usr/local/bin/swagger-codegen"
$SWAGGER_CODE_GEN generate -i  ./api.yaml -l python-flask -o ./ -DpackageName=esm --import-mappings object=#

# client files
$SWAGGER_CODE_GEN generate -i  ./apidef/swagger/open_service_broker_api.yaml -l python -o ./client -DpackageName=esm-client
```
